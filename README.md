# rotating-ais-evolution
AIs learn how to survive in a basic world. Based on [ai-test](https://github.com/tropicsapling/ai-test), but with improved functionality and adaption. The goal is to make `ai.js` easily adaptable to other simple games. If you want to try this with another game make a new game and make some minor edits to `ai.js`. When changing the inputs you can also use the special command `__EXENOW(code_to_execute)__` to run code when the AI's genes are generated. For example if you'd put `__EXENOW(Math.floor(Math.random() * ai[id].length))__` that would generate a random number that is the id of one of the AI's genes, which could for example become `5`. After execution all parts of the special command will be removed, only the result of the execution will be left in the genes and later executed in your own `game.js` file.
